# `minify`: compression tool for collapsable bytes

### fast introduction:

 - compile using:
 ```make```

 - run using:
 ```./minify.exe file...```
 compressed file will be created as `file.min`

 - example:
 ```
 make
 ./compress.exe ~/data ~/data.min
 ```
 this will compress `data` into `data.min`,
 then decompresses `data.min` into `data`
